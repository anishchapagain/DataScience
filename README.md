Data Science using Python

‘’’We live in a world of connected things where tons of data are generated and it is humanly impossible to analyze all the incoming data and make decisions. Human decisions are increasingly replaced by decisions made by computers, thanks to the field of Data Science’’’ (Python Data Science Cookbook, Packt Publishing 2015).

Data Science is an interdisciplinary field about Scientific methods, processes and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data. Data science comprises knowledge about statistics/mathematics, analysis, information/computer science processing techniques and theories from Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Mining along Visualization.

Python as a programming language has evolved over the years and today, it is the number one choice for a data scientist. It’s ability to act as a scripting language for quick prototype building and its sophisticated language constructs for full-fledged software development combined with its fantastic library support for numeric computations has led to its current popularity among data scientists and the general scientific programming community.
